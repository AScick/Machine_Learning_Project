# Machine_Learning_Project
Bunch of exercises computed during the Machine Learning for Finance course. They cover different themes:  
  - KNN and OLS for digit identification problem.  
  - Logistic Regression.
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
  - Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).
  - Non-parametric bootstrap.
  - Bootstrap Confidence Intervals.  

For the first theme we use files GZ called zip.test and zip.train. For the others, we use the a CSV file called NASA.

I have uploaded two files for the result. One is a Rmarkdown file and the other one is a R script file (Raw_file)
